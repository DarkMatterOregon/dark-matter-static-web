## WHO WE ARE

Eugene’s premier C# & .Net development consultancy. Our founders bring more than 30 years of collective experience in building .NET infrastructure. We’ve worked with industry leaders, state & local governments as well as private enterprise large and small.  Founded in 2016 to fill a gap in regional Microsoft platform knowledge.  We’re growing, drawing additional .NET developers into our sphere of influence.

## WHAT WE DO

We build diverse teams fitted to the specific needs of your project.  Our developers have deep MS platforms knowledge (see Legacy below)  as well as the next versions of the languages and platforms.  We stay up to date on trends so we can give clear and concise direction.  We use this stuff every day.

## WHY C# & .NET?

It’s a great time to be developing in .NET.  All the code you’ve invested in over the years can live on new platforms as part of Microsoft’s adoption of Open Source with the .Net Foundation.  C# is a powerful and concise language that runs on everything from mobile on iOS and Android, to the PC with UWP, to the web and cloud with .NET Core.  There is so much excitement around C# and .NET it’s like a new renaissance for the platform.
