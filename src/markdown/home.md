## OPEN TOOLS AND OPEN LEADERSHIP

It’s a great time to be working in open source.  We are agile practitioners and use open tools and open leadership to impliment your project.  Beyond our consultancy, we are civicially engaged with local open projects and provide leadership as Mozilla Open Leaders.  We use those same tools on your project, making sure it's easy to collaborate and add contributors. It all starts with a conversation, so we'd love to hear from you.
