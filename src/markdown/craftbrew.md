**_Dark Matter Consulting and Brooklyn Brewery_** have teamed up in order to successfully develop and launch an enterprise reporting system that provides mission critical tax and regulatory reporting not available out of the box in D365. The system allows Brooklyn Brewery to operate within the boundaries of state and federal brewer’s operational regulations. The **_cloud-based_** system architecture consists of several lean and very efficient data processing technologies in addition to industry leading best practices using Kimball data warehousing design principles. The operational costs and initial capital expenditures are **_significantly lower_** then an onsite EDW implementation.

• Azure SQL Data Warehouse is a fast, flexible and trusted cloud data warehouse that lets you scale, compute and store elastically and independently, with a massively parallel processing architecture.

• D365 BYOD lets you export one or more data entities that are available in D365 Finance and Operations with more than 1,700 data entities are available out of the box to eliminate the need for costly replication systems to get data out of the live system into a warehouse staging environment or operational data store.

• Azure Data Factory is a hybrid data integration service that allows you to create, schedule and orchestrate your E1TL/ELT SSIS workflows giving you the ability to orchestrate SSIS packages to load data into dimensional models and data marts in the data warehouse

• SSRS provides the platform to fulfill specific reporting needs and subscription-based reporting delivery from the Enterprise Data Warehouse.

#### These technologies combined with the Data Warehouse and Business Intelligence experience **_Dark Matter Consulting_** brings to the table have contributed to the successful completion of the Brooklyn Brewery BI/DW implementation allowing the team to meet reporting requirements and complete the project **_on time and under budget_**.
