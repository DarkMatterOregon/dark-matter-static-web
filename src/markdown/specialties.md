We gotta burn the rain forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up the OZONE! 'Cause maybe if we screw up this planet enough, they won't want it anymore! I was part of something special. So you two dig up, dig up dinosaurs? Do you have any idea how long it takes those cups to decompose.

Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine? Eventually, you do plan to have dinosaurs on your dinosaur tour, right? Do you have any idea how long it takes those cups to decompose. Yes, Yes, without the oops! Forget the fat lady! You're obsessed with the fat lady! Drive us out of here!

My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you little bastard! Hey, you know how I'm, like, always trying to save the planet? Here's my chance. This thing comes fully loaded. AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats, and... power windows.
